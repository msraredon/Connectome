\arguments{
\item{differential.connectome}{A differential connectome, made with DifferentialConnectome. May be filtered as desired prior to plotting.}

\item{features}{Gene of interest. Output will be limited to edges including these specific genes.}

\item{sources.include}{Source nodes of interest. Output will be limited to edges coming from these sources.}

\item{targets.include}{Target nodes of interest. Output will be limited to edges landing on these targets.}

\item{min.score}{Default NULL. Will limit output to edges with a differential score greater than this value.}

\item{min.pct}{Default NULL. Threshold to return clusterwise observations for both ligand and receptor. Only needs to be satisfied in connect.1 OR in connect.2.}

\item{verbose}{Whether to output feedback to user}

\item{infinity.to.max}{Default TRUE.  If TRUE, will create a pseudo value to replace values of "Inf"}

\item{edge.color.by.source}{Default TRUE - edges will be colored by their source cell type. If false, edges will be colored by receiving cell instead.}

\item{cols.use}{Optional. Colors for plotting nodes.}

\item{lab.cex}{Text size for gene names}

\item{title}{Character string for title of plot.}
}
\description{
Currently in beta testing. A Circos Plot for a differential edgelist made using DifferentialConnectome. Note that negative log fold changes cannot be plotted; therefore, this plot uses the 'score' for the differential comparison, which is always positive in proportion to perturbation.
