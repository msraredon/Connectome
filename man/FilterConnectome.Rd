\arguments{
\item{connectome}{A connectomic edgelist output from CreateConnectome}

\item{min.pct}{Minimum fraction of cells within a given cluster expressing the ligand or receptor.}

\item{max.p}{Maximum p-value for ligand and receptor. Filtration on this column requires prior p-value calculation.}

\item{min.DOR}{Minimum log-normalized Diagnostic Odds Ratio for the ligand or receptor for its cell type within an edge.}

\item{min.exp}{Minimum normalized expression level of ligand and receptor.}

\item{min.z}{Minimum z-score for ligand and receptor.}

\item{modes.include}{String or vector signifying mode(s) of interest in include.}

\item{sources.include}{Source nodes of interest. Output will be limited to edges coming from these sources.}

\item{targets.include}{Target nodes of interest. Output will be limited to edges landing on these targets.}

\item{mechanisms.include}{Ligand - Receptor pairs of interest. The character string should match entries in the 'pair' column of the connectome.}

\item{verbose}{Whether to output feedback to user}

\item{remove.na}{Whether to remove edges containing 'NA' (no mapping to original object - only useful if investigating orphan ligands and receptors)}
}
\description{
Filters a connectomic edgelist output from CreateConnectome according to user inputs. Defaults are set to reasonable initial parameters for data clean-up and exploration.
